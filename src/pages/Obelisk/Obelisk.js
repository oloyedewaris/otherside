            Welcome, Voyager. If you hold an Otherdeed, you hold a key to this evolving vision of Otherside —
            and to shaping what it becomes.

          <h1>FIRST TRIP</h1>
          <p>
            The first tech demo of the Otherside, for Voyagers only.
            A celebration of what’s to come and an opportunity for Voyagers to gather, explore, and plan.

          <p>
            Learn how to link your lands, and more, in the Otherside Codex, a living document co-written with the Voyagers.
            Remember, today’s decisions bring possibilities and risks for the future of the Otherside,
            so tread carefully.

          <h1>KODA ORIGINS // THE DECOUPLING</h1>
          <p>
            A cosmic earthquake shakes up our universe, bringing with it a vision into the Kodas’ past and an 
            opportunity for Voyagers to decouple their Otherdeeds’ constituent parts. 
            Where do the Kodas and their artifacts go from here? Voyagers decide.

          <h1>THE GROWTH</h1>
          <p>
            The lands of the Otherside rumble to life, generating resources, 
            but a destructive and invasive species also emerges. Heed the Codex, Voyager.

          <h1>THE AGORA</h1>
          <p>
            Voyagers, come together to buy, sell, barter, and trade for what you need. Or craft new items from raw materials. 
            Let us build, create, and innovate with each other.

          <h1>THE DREAM</h1>
          <p>
            An (impossible?) arcade machine emerges at the center of the Biogenic Swamp. Use your trip wisely and be rewarded.

          <h1>THE CHOICE</h1>
          <p>
            What lies beyond the Otherside? What creatures call it home – and are they friends or foes? New lands 
            activate and are available for Voyagers. 
            It’s time to choose a side.
