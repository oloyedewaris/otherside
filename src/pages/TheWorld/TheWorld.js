            We set out to build the Otherside with one thing in mind: the metaverse should be anything but boring.
            The world should be dynamic, steeped in narrative, and your actions should hold consequence.
            Step into the Otherside, where the normal rules do not apply.
            Where you end up is up to chance. Where you go is up to you.
